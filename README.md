# Spring Security Basics
Hello Devs,

In this project, I have completed the basic implementation of Spring Security features. I learned the default Spring Security behavior, which is provided by simply adding Spring Security to the pom file.

Next, I explored the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter class and checked its configure() method. I looked at the following implementations:

InMemoryUserDetailsManager
JdbcUserDetailsManager
Modified UserDetails and UserDetailsService interfaces to customize user behavior with regards to password, username, and role.
I also delved into the basics of password encoder, Spring Bean, Spring Container, ApplicationContext, Spring IOC, Spring Annotation, Dependency Injection, and more.

I would like to express my gratitude to Genie Ashwani who created an amazing playlist of Spring Security. Anyone who wants to learn more about it can refer to his playlist on YouTube here (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLciPu9FabM_5eWhd3sW8GKA2Um4qbmrcC).

Thanks for visiting my project!
